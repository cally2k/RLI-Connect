                <h1>Developer</h1>
                <p>The Retail & Leisure sectors have experienced huge challenges across the world as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and will continue to face unprecedented market disruptions for the foreseeable future. In order to survive and thrive in a post Covid world, the retail industry needs to evolve and seek opportunities that have arisen. This year's event aims to connect you with the right partners to facilitate transformation and expansion strategies in a ‘New Era’.</p>

                    <h4 class="Question">Why Should I Take Part?</h4>
                    <p class="Answer">As we all come to terms with new shared realities, staying connected has never been more prevalent. Save time and money with all your pre-arranged meetings under one roof. As it’s a hybrid event, those who are longing to meet in person have the power of face-to-face whilst those still unable to travel can take advantage of the virtual element, enabling you to find those new-to-market retailers and unique and innovative leisure and entertainment concepts for your malls, mixed-use destinations, high-streets and outlet centres. Make new connections, form strategic partnerships and sign those deals, all from one physical or digital location…one event two experiences.</p>

                    <h4 class="Question">How Can I Take Part?</h4>
                    <p class="Answer">Attend the event by completing the Developer Registration Form. Once registered you will be assigned a dedicated meeting planner to organise your schedule for the event.  On arrival at the physical event you will be taken to your own private meeting room where you will meet the people you have pre-arranged meetings with. In between meetings you will have the opportunity to network with other delegates in a central location. If you are utilising the virtual element we will ensure you are connected with your pre-arranged one to one meetings at the allotted times.<br><br>The physical event allows you to either have unlimited meetings over the two days in a fully branded private meeting room, which will allow you to share presentations and videos and includes your own personal dedicated meeting planner for £5,000. Alternatively if you do not have the full two days to allocate to meetings, you may arrange individual meetings at £250 per meeting, which will be arranged by your dedicated meeting planner, these will take place in a central location.</p>

                    <h4 class="Question">What Do I Need To Prepare?</h4>
                    <p class="Answer">In order for you to have a successful event it is essential that you plan your schedule in advance and research the Retailers / Leisure Operators that you wish to meet prior to the event.<br><br>If you do not pre-arrange meetings you will not reap the benefits as Retailers / Leisure Operators tend to organise their itineraries and have little or no time for additional meetings.</p>
